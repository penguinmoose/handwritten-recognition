# handwritten-recognition
A flask app to recognize handwritten digits. Uses TensorFlow.

For this to work, you will have to install [`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/penguinmoose/handwritten-recognition/blob/main/requirements.txt).

To run the app locally, enter the following two commands:
```
export FLASK_APP=run.py
flask run
```
To rerun after quitting the application, you don't have to enter the first command.
